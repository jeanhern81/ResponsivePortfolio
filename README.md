## Responsive Portfolio
---
## Description:

This updated portfolio features a working navbar that is also mobile responsive, along with a footer with LinkIn and GitHug icons that will take you to those sites. The portfolio page features eat-da-burger, weather dashboard, workday scheduler, my group project, Alexandria. 

With this portfolio update I went a head and created a working contact form, deployed it to heroku, and linked a custom domain to the heroku deployment.
